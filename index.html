                        <p>
                            I'm James, a JavaScript full stack engineer specialising in UI. I code interfaces that do useful things, just like the UI you're reading now. My favourite front end framework is React + Redux, and I love writing servers in Node + Express with a NoSQL database. I'm excited about GraphQL, TypeScript, and Docker.   
                        </p>
                                        
                        <p>
                            After teaching myself to code and working for some amazing companies, I loved it so much I decided to study software development at university. I'm looking forward to learning C++, Java, and Python, and my ultimate goal is to become completely framework agnostic. 
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            Before I wrote code, I wrote and edited novels. My clients have won awards, secured publishing contracts, increased sales, ranked in Amazon's Top 40, amassed critical acclaim, and gained a die-hard following. Language and communication is very important to me, and I like working with companies who communicate well.

                            My interest in Information Technology started with web development and was heavily influenced by the fin-tech companies I interned for during this time. I came to appreciate charting frameworks like D3.js and Charts.js, and how data visualisations could transform cryptic numbers into meaningful information.

                        <p>
                            I remember working on that trading engine interface and just being in awe of the designs. It was a pixel-perfect implementation, and I painstakingly made sure of this by using a transparent overlay of the original PSD files. This certainly instils a love and appreciation of details. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The next company I joined was the most popular desktop cryptocurrency wallet in the world, Exodus, and after working alongside truly exceptional engineers, I decided I needed to improve my skills before I felt comfortable calling myself a developer. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This is where RMIT's Bachelor of Information Technology comes in! The flexibility of online learning will allow me to pursue another passion of mine starting next year, and that's health care. I plan to balance studying a Diploma of Nursing and work placements with this degree.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Ultimately, being a self-taught developer can leave theoretical gaps in understanding. I expect to learn the nitty-gritty computer science stuff like binary search trees, memory allocation, and the influential languages like Java and Python. You don't know what you don't know, so I'm sure the topics covered will be amazing!

                            This looks like a junior / graduate e-commerce web developer job, most likely coding dashboards that serve as a GUI to help sellers setup and manage their online stores. I'm sure it would mostly be front end development, but they do want a developer who knows how to write servers in Node, so they're looking for a generalist that can do a bit of everything.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I like this position because the requirements for the role are reasonable; it's really not uncommon to see junior developer job listings with the same requirements as a mid-level, or even senior, engineer. With my experience in JavaScript, it would be a good fit for me, and I'd have the opportunity to learn AWS, which is one of the many technologies on my to-learn list.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I'm sure some experience with a CMS like Wordpress and a payment processor like Braintree would be advantageous. I have dabbled in eCommerce in the past as well as self-hosted Wordpress deployments, so this could be another talking point for me. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Likewise, I do have customer service experience working over the HelpDesk platform and helping users of the Exodus cryptocurrency wallet manage and troubleshoot their digital assets. I really enjoy getting the opportunity to be social with the end users of the software I'm working on, so there might be some nice opportunities at this company to dual-skill as technical support.                       
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The job listing closes by mentioning attitude. Everyone loves working with a passionate, easy-going developer who is humble enough to handle a code review and won't feel personally attacked if the tech lead needs code to be rewritten. It's always amazing if a company organises social days for team building, and their use of the word “casual” leads me to believe they're looking for a relaxed candidate who can have a laugh and doesn't take themselves too seriously.                            
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Finally, they do mention a technical challenge, and these challenges can be very time consuming, and if an engineer has multiple interviews, it can mean doing several weeks of free work on algorithms and sample apps no one will ever use.                         
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I feel I already have the technical skills for this position, but I should really move AWS and Docker forwards on my list of priorities. These skills are becoming absolutely mandatory, and I'm going to be at a disadvantage if I don't take the time to learn the DevOps stuff. All in all, this company gives me really good vibes!                    
                        </p>

                            I took the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test, and I got the Campaigner personality type (ENFP-t). Campaigners make up 7% of the population and are defined by their high level of intuition <a href="#ref-1">[1]</a>. The idea that people can be grouped using four metrics that measure decision-making and perception along a continuum—introversion/extroversion, sensing/intuition, thinking/feeling, and judging/perception—was proposed by the psychiatrist Carl Jung <a href="#ref-2">[2]</a>. This original conceptual theory was developed into a self-report that measures these dimensions by mother-and-daughter team Katharine Briggs and Isabel Myers <a href="#ref-3">[3]</a>.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Meyers Briggs Results</h2>
                        <ul>

                        <p>
                            I took a learning-style test called The VARK questionnaire (Visual, Aural, Reading, Kinesthetic). This test was developed by teacher Neil Fleming, and it was based on an earlier model that only took three dimensions of learning into account (VAK) <a href="#ref-4">[4]</a>. I got the Multimodal (AK) learning preference <a href="#ref-5">[5]</a>. The majority of the population, 50-70%, have multiple learning preferences and fit this learning type <a href="#ref-6">[6]</a>.   
                        </p>

                        <h2>VARK Results</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Visual:</b> 2</li>
                            <li><b>Aural:</b> 7</li>
                            <li><b>Read/Write:</b> 0</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            The next test I took was the classic Five-Factor model developed by Robert McCrae and Paul Costa that measures personality over these five factors: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism <a href="#ref-7">[7]</a>.

                            I find these results somewhat surprising having previously been analyst types like the architect. It seems like I've become more emotional and less analytical as time has passed, which means I'll have to make a conscious effort to look at the finer details I could miss when working with a team and getting carried away with a project.

                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>
                            I intend to build a social platform that has one key difference than the already saturated marketplace of social media <a href="#ref-9">[9]</a>. My application won't support text or image posts and will instead force users to submit either audio or video posts to their profile. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This application will be cross-platform and feature a message-context border for posts. Users will be able to choose the “tone” of recordings from an “emoji wheel” that corresponds to the main emotion the recording conveys. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Audio posts will be the default mode of submission and for good reason. This initial research suggests that audio books are better at eliciting emotion than films <a href="#ref-10">[10]</a>. I also believe it will be more natural to make a quick audio post than a video recording.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Motivation</h2>
                        <p>
                            I'm passionate about people, relationships, and human connection, so I wanted to create a multi-platform app that can add another dimension to the online experience of social media. I came to realise that the prime difference between social media platforms is the default medium of expression and the restrictions surrounding this.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For example, Twitter enforces a character limit of 280 characters <a href="#ref-11">[11]</a>. This results in frequent and short posts that read like a stream-of-consciousness, which encourages users to share their thoughts as they occur. It's the inherent rules built into a platform that determine the mode of social expression.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            However, I feel like regardless of whether an application forces the user to write a message of a certain length or post a picture, these mediums are lacking the emotional depth of  face-to-face human communication. This can best be seen in the platitude “93% of communication is non-verbal”; importantly, this figure was originally derived by combining 55% body language and 38% tone of voice that make up the total <a href="#ref-12">[12]</a>. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            What this means for social media is that text-based messages and emoticons are an inadequate form of expression. How I intend to solve this problem is to make a platform where text-based messages aren't supported, which forces the user to either send voice messages or short videos in the exact same way Twitter's character limit forces people to share bite-sized ideas.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Description</h2>
                        <p>
                            Users join the platform by entering their real name, password, and email address into a standard sign up form. The app is usable at this point, and the next screen is a profile page. The ability to personalise the profile by adding a picture and biography is locked until the user confirms their email address. In a world where our attention span is nearing that of a goldfish <a href="#ref-13">[13]</a>, it's important that the app is immediately usable and provides users with the option of doing clerical tasks later.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The next view is a minimal dark-themed UI that is the user's page where their posts display in a masonry-style tiled layout. At the bottom of this page is two floating icons: a microphone and a video camera. Users can begin recording in audio or video by choosing the appropriate icon. At this point, the icon expands to bring up an overlay that shows the length of the recording, a preview button, an emoji button, and a post button that is unusable until the user selects an appropriate emoji for the recording.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At the top of the user's page is a floating menu that can take user's to their feed, a view that shows the content of everyone they follow, and a link to the profile page. The feed's content is playable directly from this page, but a replies link underneath, showing the total number of replies per post, expands into a thread-style interface where users can reply to one another's content.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There is no like feature on this platform in order to inspire legitimate interaction.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Imagine recording a quick 20 second audio update about your day, which went well. You select one of the many positive emojis from the emoji button inside the recording tab, which adds a green border around the finished post on the user's page. This is the equivalent of captioning a photo on another platform, and right away, the audience in your social platform can see you just made a positive post.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This brief but incomplete insight into the context of the recording adds a dimension of personality to the user's profile and also drives curiosity. “I wonder what that happy-looking recording is about?” Key-frame video previews are intentionally hidden for this reason. At a higher level, this feature also acts as a gate keeper and content filter.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We all have that friend who largely posts negative content, and this can be overwhelming. Maybe a user has a preference for only following people with green, happy feeds. Likewise, when we're in a dark place, it can be beneficial to engage with people having similar experiences, and a blue feed would quickly enable someone to convey they're not okay to friends and families without coming out and directly saying it.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Finally, this application is accessible by default to those with reading and writing problems and those with vision impairment. And because audio recording are the default mode of submission, this platform could potentially be amazing for musicians and artists. I see this platform as being a better digital representation of socialising.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
                        <p>
                            This application is built using the core web technologies of HTML5, CSS3, and ECMAScript 10.
                            These technologies get consolidated using Electron.js to become a desktop application that can also run in the browser <a href="#ref-14">[14]</a>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The front end uses React.js, Redux, and SCSS. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The back end uses Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For the mobile version of this application, React Native will be used <a href="#ref-15">[15]</a>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Because this application is basically a forum that uses the HTML5 input field's new attribute “capture” that allows users to use their microphone or camera to record audio or video, and because I've built a forum in the past, I can list the exact dependencies that this project's package.json will require.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Required Skills</h2>
                        <p>
                            Passionate full stack cross-platform web developer with dev-ops knowledge wanted for growing social startup. Do you like making pretty UIs in React and React Native then AJAXing them together with a Node.js end point? Yes? Awesome!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We're not looking for a “rock star” developer because in our experience, rock stars are better at rock than they are at writing software, but we are looking for someone who loves staring at an IDE and values people and relationships.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We're not even looking for a developer with “work experience” or “qualifications”, so long as you've coded some applications in your free time and had fun doing it. And we're certainly not going to waste your time with technical challenges, so let's nerd-out and talk about your preexisting code instead! 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So what do we want, exactly?
                        </p>

                        <h3>Need to Have</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Passion</li>
                            <li>AWS</li>
                            <li>React and React Native</li>
                            <li>Node.js</li>
                            <li>ES10, HTML, and SCSS</li>
                            <li>Electron.js</li>
                            <li>Any noSQL database</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Amazing to Have:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A lot of passion</li>
                            <li>Docker and Kubernetes</li>
                            <li>Webpack and Babel</li>
                            <li>Typescript, GraphQL, Apollo Server, Redux</li>
                            <li>Git</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Why Work for Us?</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Best-in-class equipment</li>
                            <li>A toxic-free workplace</li>
                            <li>A competitive salary</li>
                            <li>LGBT+ inclusive space</li>
                            <li>Mandatory 25 days of paid vacation a year (no more worrying about “unlimited” vacation policies)</li>
                            <li>Uniform-free workplace (wear whatever you want, even PJs)</li>
                            <li>Weekly social days (we have drinks together and LAN party)</li>
                            <li>Healthy meals made by our in-house chef</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            Finding a developer with this skill set isn't a technical challenge, but finding a developer who is a culture fit and able to contribute positively to the atmosphere of the workplace is much more challenging. To combat this, an informal talking-style interview is absolutely essential.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The software and hardware is all stock-standard and almost not worth talking about, but this project certainly doesn't require anything that can't be forked for free or bought from any technology store in the country. And the cloud-based AWS hosting is mere clicks away from being functional, so the technology in this stack is all very accessible.  
                        </p>

                        <h2>Outcome</h2>
                        <p>
                            This platform will humanise the impersonal state of digital socialising by adding the emotional depth of inflections, expressions, tone of voice, gestures, and all manner of micro communications in a way that texts and still-frame snapshots could never compete against.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The built-in content filtering of the context border will ideally provide a healthier online social experience without the meaningless exchange of validation in the form of likes, upvotes, and hearts. Content will be more interactive and personal by default after removing content previews that allow users to skim rather than engage. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Accessibility for vision impaired users is a considerable advantage as well as creating a space for musicians and artists to share their work. The sum of this application's parts will be a social experience that will disrupt the social economy of validation in favour of personal content presented in a minimal UI that's free of the feature clutter associated with older established platforms.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The overall impact is a social media experience that better fits human communication.
                        </p>
